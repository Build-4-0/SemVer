# SemVer
A Semantic Release repo to automate the release/tagging.

 # Commit message format for Semantic Release

semantic-release uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages, semantic-release automatically determines the next semantic version number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.

## Must be one of the following:

| Commit Message [MAJOR]                                                  | ReleaseType     | Format |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------:| ------:|
| **feat:** Adding new feature with major changes                         | Major Release   | 1.0.0  |
| ***BREAKING CHANGE:*** Adding this changes will improve performance                                |


| Commit Message [MINOR/FEATURE]                                          | ReleaseType     | Format |

:warning: Known issues and fixes :warning:

### Semantic release does not update package.json and the release artifact
* Fix: Make sure to use the **.releaserc** file at the root of the repo in the same order, ie, /npm before the /git in the plugins
